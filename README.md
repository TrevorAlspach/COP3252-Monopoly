# Monopoly Game Project for COP3252
## By: Trever Alspach, Kaitlin Tran, and Benjamin Zech

### Game instructions

- Requires 2-4 players
- Each player starts off with $1500
- Players begin at the “Go” space and move clockwise around the board (contains 40 spaces)
- Wild cards
  - If a player lands on a chance or community chest space, they must draw a chance/community card from the deck and follow directions.
- Jail
  - Players in jail cannot play until they pay $50 bail.
- Owning property
  - If a player lands on an unowned property, they have the choice to buy it using money.
  - If a player lands on an owned property, they owe the owner of the property rent money.
- Monopoly
  - If a player owns every property of a single color, they have a monopoly. Rent is doubled.
  - Players that own monopolies can build houses and hotels on properties to increase rent.
- If you run out of money, you’re out. Winner is the last player standing

### Interface

- In the start window, choose the number of players (2-4) by clicking on the corresponding button.
- Roll 2 dice to move spaces by using the “Roll Dice” button.
  - If you roll doubles, you can roll again.
  - If you roll doubles 3 times, you go to jail.
- If you land on an unowned space, you will be prompted with the question to buy the property.
  - Select “yes” means you pay the price and own the property.
    - You can view your properties in a separate tab with the “View Properties” button.
      - You can buy houses and hotels in this tab once you own a monopoly of properties.
- If you land on an owned space, you automatically pay rent to the owner.
- If you are in jail when your turn begins, you will automatically pay the $50 bail.
- If you land on a chance or community chest space, the effects of the card (moving spacing, losing/gaining money) will automatically take place.
- If you are done with your turn, click the “Next Turn” button.
